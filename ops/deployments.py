The network is the one COLOSSEUM_NETWORK names (spike/hlspike/network.py), the same switch the tools read through
spike/hlspike/common.py, so a keeper started on mainnet reads mainnet's records and never testnet's. A record must
say it is on that network: its chain_id is the network's chain id, and a `network` field, where the record has one,
names it. deployments/LIVE.json lists the records and what serves each (docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md).
