"""Each asset's own leverage cap, `Rules.assetLeverageX100` (the pools team, 21 October 2026).

The cap a pool's rules give an asset unless its plan or its command line names another, times 100.
Never over the account's own cap (`maxLeverageX100`): the contracts refuse that, so here the default
is the lower of the two. A builder dex's market is found by its coin ("xyz:XYZ100" is XYZ100).
