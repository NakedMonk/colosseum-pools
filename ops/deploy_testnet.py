"""Deploy the pool contracts to HyperEVM testnet (chain 998). Nothing else.

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_testnet.py --label rehearsal
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_testnet.py --label demo --keys-file <addresses.txt from ops/make_demo_keys.py>

The implementations are larger than a small HyperEVM block allows (3M gas), so the deployer
switches itself to big blocks (about one a minute, 30M gas) for the deployment and back
afterwards. That switch is a HyperCore action, so the deployer must already exist there.

Writes deployments/testnet-<label>.json: addresses, transaction hashes, the git commit the
bytecode was built from, and the platform asset list. Refuses to overwrite a label. The record
is written after every contract and every later transaction, with a `status` field, and each
write replaces the whole file, so a failure half way still leaves the addresses on disk. A
failure after the first transaction marks the record `incomplete`, which nothing downstream
loads.

Key addresses published with --keys-file are the demo's agent keys, made with
ops/make_demo_keys.py and kept on the gateway host; a registry never forgets a key, so publish
only keys that host will hold.
