A second round with two depositors, on a pool whose seats the demo's factory makes (the seat keeps
the demo's proportion, a challenge a tenth of the funded capital, and is too small to trade: the
round needs capital at work, not a trader):

A seat a trader can trade: 3 USDC of challenge capital at five times is a $15 position, above
Hyperliquid's $10 minimum order, under rules the Economics page's model has a figure for. The trader
buys its challenge and trades it through the pool gateway with agents.client, the way the app does:

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_shared.py --label shared-trade --on-demo-factory
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade wallets --trader-evm 2.2

        --target-bps 800 --daily-bps 500 --drawdown-bps 1000 --duration 86400 --term 86400
    (deposit A, deposit B, settle, arm, as above)
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo --wallet shared-trader --gateway GATEWAY_URL buy SEAT 1.5
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo --wallet shared-trader --gateway GATEWAY_URL \\
        order CHALLENGE BTC buy SIZE PRICE --type ioc

A pool with several seats of different sizes: `seat` once for each, then `seal`. The steps that act on
one seat, `arm`, `buy`, `expire` and `release`, then need to be told which, by its place in the pool's
list (from 1) or by its address; with one seat they need nothing:

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-demo2b seat --capital 10 --funded 100 --price 2 ...
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-demo2b seat --capital 20 --funded 200 --price 4 ...
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-demo2b seal
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-demo2b arm --seat 2

A deposit at a price other than 1, and the way out at the same price: a third depositor on that pool,
once its value is no longer its number of shares. The point mints the deposit times the shares over
the value, and the price of a share, and everyone else's holding, stay where they were:

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade wallets --only shared-dep-c --no-trader
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade deposit --who shared-dep-c
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade settle
    # the lock (600 s) runs from that point; `request` says how long is left
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade request --who shared-dep-c
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/shared_run.py --deployment shared-trade settle

Testnet only (hlspike.common refuses anything else). Wallets are read by name from
COLOSSEUM_KEY_DIR and never printed: `shared-operator` runs the pool, `shared-dep-a` and
`shared-dep-b` deposit, `shared-trader` buys a challenge on the seat. Nobody trades in this run;
the challenge is there so that capital is at work while someone waits to be paid. Every step
reads the chain again before acting and records what it did and what it saw in
spike/results/<date>.jsonl.
