"""The shared pool's keeper: the calls anyone may make on a SharedPool, made when the pool would take them.

    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.shared_keeper --deployment shared-run --once --dry-run   # what is due
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.shared_keeper --deployment shared-run --once             # one pass
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.shared_keeper --deployment shared-run                    # a service loop
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.shared_keeper --deployment shared-demo2b,shared-demo2c   # two pools, one wallet

Several pools, their labels joined by commas, are kept by one process with one wallet: a pass goes
through them one after another, so their calls never race each other for the wallet's nonce, and a pass
that breaks off on one pool is logged and the next pool's still runs.

The seats' challenges and funded stages are ordinary pools of the deployment's factory, and the core
keeper (ops/keeper.py, run with the same deployment) already takes them through their lives:
activate, checkpoint, breach, expire, settle, recut. This one does what only a shared pool has, in
this order on every pass:

  a funded seat       → noteFunded when its stage is new to the pool; endFundedTerm once the stage
                        has run the term the seat was published with
  a short queue       → releaseSeat for an idle seat holding capital, while the queue needs more
                        than the pool has free
  deposits, a queue   → settle, naming the open tickets that hold a deposit; for a queue alone at
                        most once every --queue-every seconds, since its money comes in slowly
  money to spare      → armSeat for an idle seat short of its capital, then prepareAccount on it

Every call is first tried with eth_estimateGas from the keeper's own address and sent only if the
contract would take it. The rules live in SharedPool; the keeper keeps no second copy of them, only
the judgement of when a call is worth its gas. It reads the contract's state and the precompiles
through eth_call and never the event log. Nothing here is privileged: `--wallet` is any funded
testnet key. Testnet only.
