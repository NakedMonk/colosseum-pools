"""Deploy factory v3 in one command: its key registry, the account implementations, the factory, the
paper exam, the reader, and on testnet the demo's own USDC. Then the factory's settings and the
agent keys. The pools team, 19-21 October 2026.

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_v3.py --label demo3 --keys-file <addresses.txt> --faucet 0x... --dry-run
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_v3.py --label demo3 --keys-file <addresses.txt> --faucet 0x...
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_v3.py --label v3 --network mainnet --dry-run

What it deploys, in order (big blocks on, then off):
- DemoUsdc (testnet only): the token prices and payouts are in. Its operator, the deployer, mints
  any amount; --faucet mints up to --faucet-daily a UTC day. The chain's testnet USDC is not ours
  to mint.
- KeyRegistry, AccountOps (the library the accounts link to), Pool, ChallengeAccount.
- PoolFactory(registry, Pool, ChallengeAccount, operator, token).
- PaperExam: the exam implementation every MultiPool sells.
- MultiPoolReader.

What it sets, in order:
- setAccountSource: the registry takes accounts from this factory alone.
- setPlatformAssets and setFundedAssets: BTC, ETH and SOL for exams; BTC and ETH for a funded
  account (deep audit N6).
- setExamImpl: the paper exam is the one a shares contract binds (cloud audit, section 6).
- setSharesCode: the hash of out/PoolShares.json's creation code, the one code the factory creates
  shares contracts from.
- setChallengeFee: CHALLENGE_FEE to the operator.
- setFaucet on the token: --faucet and --faucet-daily.
- publish: the keys of --keys-file. Each is refused if any registry this project has deployed
  knows it, by the deployment records and deployments/registries.json (audit window 2, A5-3).

Writes deployments/<network>-v3-<label>.json after every transaction, a `status` field included,
as ops/deploy_testnet.py does. The record holds every address and transaction, and the keccak of
each contract's creation code (out/) and of its code on chain. It also names the network's
parameters: chain id, token, CoreWriter and the precompiles.

Each network's chain id, RPC, API and USDC come from spike/hlspike/network.py. --network mainnet
--dry-run prints the whole plan for mainnet and sends nothing: the chain's USDC and no DemoUsdc, the
address of each contract when --deployer names the address the owner will deploy from (read from
its nonce on mainnet), mainnet's perp numbers for the listed assets (read from its meta), the gas
and its price today (scripts/mainnet_gas.py) and the record it would write. It only reads public
endpoints, and holds no key. A mainnet run without --dry-run is refused here, before anything is
read: sending to mainnet is a decision of its own.
