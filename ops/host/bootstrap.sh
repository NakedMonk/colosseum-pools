# The gateway and the keeper deliberately use DIFFERENT nodes. Both rate-limit per IP, and
# this host is one IP: while they shared a node, anyone outside could spend the keeper's budget
# by calling the public gateway, which costs five chain reads per request before it refuses.
# A blinded keeper does not stop a trader who has broken the rules, and the investor pays for
# the delay. The keeper is the one that cannot move: Hyperliquid's node refuses its eth_getLogs
# from this host (see the note below), so the keeper keeps the node that serves logs and the
# gateway takes the other one. The gateway makes no eth_getLogs call at all -- it only reads
# state with eth_call -- so that refusal does not reach it.
#
# The node the gateway moves TO is the tighter of the two: about 100 calls a minute against
# the other's 200. ops/host/nginx-pools-api.conf.in is cut to fit that, and the two must be
# deployed together -- the old limits against this node would have the gateway refusing
# honest traders out of a budget we set ourselves.
