# Puts one commit of this repository on the pools host through AWS Systems Manager: no ssh, and no
# address of the host anywhere. Testnet only.
#
# Not usable on the pools host yet: on 5 November 2026 the instance has no role, its SSM agent is not
# registered and there is no bucket. Until that is set up, releases go through ops/host/deploy.sh.
# docs/HOSTING.md, "How the host is reached", says what to set up.
#
#   COLOSSEUM_SSM_BUCKET=<bucket> ops/host/deploy-ssm.sh <commit> <instance id>
#
# The same release as ops/host/deploy.sh: only a commit on origin/main, its tracked files as a git
# archive made here, and that commit's ops/host/install.sh run as root on the host. Only the road
# differs. The archive (2.4 MB gzipped on 3 November 2026) is far over what one Run Command carries
# (a document is capped at 64 KB), so it goes to S3 under a key of its own run, and the host fetches
# it through a presigned link: the instance's role needs no S3 permission, and only this machine's
# environment names the bucket. The host checks the archive's sha256, taken here, before it unpacks
# anything. AWS credentials and the region come from the aws CLI's own configuration.
#
# Three times bound a run. The agent has COLOSSEUM_SSM_DELIVERY_S (10 minutes) to take the command,
# or SSM itself ends it as TimedOut; the link lives that long plus curl's 5 minutes, since the host
# fetches first. The install then has COLOSSEUM_SSM_EXEC_S (25 minutes). This script waits for the
# sum and two more, so SSM ends the command before the wait does. The archive is removed once the
# command has ended, or was never sent; while it may still run, it stays and the script says where.
