"""Deploy a shared pool on testnet (chain 998), on a factory and key registry of its own or on an
existing deployment's.

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_shared.py --label shared-run --keys-file <addresses.txt> \\
        --min-deposit 20 --lock 600
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_shared.py --label shared-demo2b --on-factory-of demo2 \\
        --min-deposit 50 --lock 600 [--dry-run]

The fee is the platform's share of a holder's own gain, fixed in the contract for good. It is 0
unless --fee-bps says otherwise: the platform takes no part of what an investor gains. The pools
deployed before 5 October 2026 were given 1000 by hand, when that was the default here.

With --on-factory-of <label> only the SharedPool is deployed, and its seats are made by that
deployment's factory: they are pools of it like any other, served by its gateway, its pages and its
keeper on the operator's host, and a challenge on them takes a key from its registry. Don't run
ops/keeper.py with such a deployment yourself: it follows every challenge of that factory, the
deployment's own pools included. --on-demo-factory is --on-factory-of demo, the first deployment.

--dry-run makes every check a real run makes -- the label is free, the base deployment's source is
this commit's, the contracts build, the factory lists the assets, the operator is on HyperCore and
holds gas -- and sends nothing.

The run's seats don't trade, so its agent keys never go near the gateway host: a registry of its
own keeps them apart from the demo's, and a factory of its own keeps the run's seats out of the
demo's list of pools. The pool and challenge implementations are the demo's, cloned from the
addresses in deployments/testnet-demo.json; this refuses to go on if their source has changed
since the commit that deployment recorded.

Signs with the `shared-operator` key, which is both the operator and the platform here, so it
needs a HyperCore account (for the switch to big blocks) and HYPE for gas. Writes
deployments/testnet-<label>.json the way ops/deploy_testnet.py does, status field included.
