    "The platform takes 0.5 % of each challenge price and 0.5 % of every withdrawal, including the return of a "
    "deposit when a raise falls short; both are already in the estimate.",
    "You alone are responsible for your money.",
    "Referral payouts. The owner of a single-investor pool, or the creator of a pool with several investors, may pay "
    "referrers out of the pool's money. The payout (a share of the exam price) and the yearly cap on payouts are set "
    "when the pool is created. They are written in the pool's terms, you see them before you deposit, and they do "
    "not change during the term. These payouts reduce what the pool earns from exams.",
