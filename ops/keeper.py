"""The operator's keeper: the calls anyone may make, made on time.

    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.keeper --deployment demo --once --dry-run   # what is due
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.keeper --deployment demo --once             # one pass
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.keeper --deployment demo                    # a service loop

Anyone can create a pool for free, so the keeper doesn't serve the factory's pool list. It
follows the factory's ChallengeCreated events instead: a pool needs the keeper from its first
challenge on, and stops needing it once it is idle with no challenge left. A challenge costs
its buyer the price and the platform fee, and the pool real capital, which is what keeps that
list short. Events are read in windows of --log-window blocks (HyperEVM answers at most 50 per
eth_getLogs call), starting where the last run stopped (the --state file) or at the factory's
deployment block. A pass that fails, say on a rate-limited RPC, is logged and the next one
starts from the same block.

The events are not enough on their own. A node that will not serve old logs leaves the scan on
one block for good, and every challenge bought after it goes unseen -- with the exam still
running and nobody to take its day's snapshot or stop it. Measured 16-18 Oct 2026: the keeper's
node went down, the one that replaced it answers reads but times old eth_getLogs out, and the
scan had to be moved to the head by hand. So once every --sweep-every passes the keeper also
reads `pools()` from the factory and asks each pool it is not following for `stage()` and
`challenge()`; one that is not idle, or has a challenge, is followed from then on. That costs
one call plus two per unfollowed pool, and anyone can add pools for free, so a sweep looks at
SWEEP_MAX of them at most and the next sweep carries on from where it stopped. A v3 factory keeps
the pools that have sold a challenge apart (`challengedCount`, `challengedFrom`), and the sweep
reads only those, SWEEP_MAX addresses a call: a pool that has sold none is never asked about,
however many there are (audit, K-1). A scan that has
not moved for SCAN_STUCK_PASSES passes with the head ahead of it says so (`scan_behind`).

For every pool it follows, one pass does what is due:
  challenge Created  → abort at once if the reserved key is spoiled; activate once the capital
                       is there, and on a builder dex once more when the dex shows it (the
                       first call only sends it there); abort after the start window if not
  challenge Active   → checkpoint in the first minutes of a UTC day; breach if a rule is broken;
                       expire after the deadline; otherwise say so if a position has no stop
  challenge stopped  → recut if the cut key still trades; settle one step
  pool Funded        → checkpoint; breach if a rule is broken; otherwise the same stop check
  pool Closing       → recut if the cut key still trades; settleFunded one step

HyperCore ignores a replacement agent that already has an account (spike question 8, 17 Sep
2026), and then the key a stop cut keeps trading. So on a stopped account the keeper asks the
info API whether `cutKey()` is still that account's agent, once `cutBlock()` is at least
RECUT_AFTER_BLOCKS behind, and calls `recut` with a fresh salt if it is.

Nothing here is privileged: the keeper uses its own testnet wallet (--wallet, default "keeper")
and only calls functions that are open to everyone. It never graduates a challenge: passing
early cuts the trader's profit short, so that call is the trader's. Testnet only.

Each pass makes about a dozen RPC reads per followed pool, and the public testnet RPC is rate
limited, so keep the interval at tens of seconds unless the keeper has its own RPC.

The reads of Hyperliquid's own API are limited too, and that budget is the host's rather than the
keeper's: the public gateway draws on the same 1200 a minute. So a pass is not guaranteed to
finish, and the pools it does not reach go unserved until the next one. It takes them in sorted
order but begins where the last pass got to, not at the top every time -- under a fixed order the
same accounts are last in every round, and where an address sorts is something its owner chooses
(audit A-14). The place is `resume_at` in the state file, and an account whose venue read was
refused does not count as a turn taken.

For the same reason the contract is asked first and asked with an empty list. Drawdown, daily
loss and leverage come off the margin precompile over EVM, which the keeper reads through its own
node: those three are answered whatever Hyperliquid is doing, and a breach found that way is sent
with no cancel list rather than not sent. Only the forbidden-asset rule needs the venue, because
the contract holds the allowed set but not the account's open positions.
