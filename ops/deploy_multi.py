"""Deploy a pool of many traders on testnet (chain 998), with everything it stands on: a key
registry, a factory on this commit's Pool, the paper exam's implementation, and one MultiPool on
a plan read from a file.

    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_multi.py --label multi-1 --plan ops/plans/multi-testnet-run.json \\
        --keys-file <addresses.txt from ops/make_demo_keys.py> [--owner 0x...] [--dry-run]
    spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_multi.py --big-blocks-off [--signer multi-operator]

The second form does one thing: it switches the signer back to small blocks. A run that died
between switching big blocks on and off leaves the wallet there, and every transaction of it
then waits for a big block, about one a minute.

Nothing of an existing deployment is used or changed. The seats of a MultiPool are pools its
owner runs (`Pool.runByOwner`), which the pools deployed before 13 October 2026 cannot do, so
this needs a factory of its own on a Pool built from this commit, and a registry of its own for
the keys its funded accounts will take.

--dry-run makes every check a real run makes -- the label is free, the contracts build, the plan
is one the contracts will take, the keys are new to every registry on record, the signer is on
HyperCore and holds gas -- and sends nothing.

The plan file is read and checked here against the same bounds the contracts hold, so a mistake
costs a message and not a deployment. Amounts are in USDC, shares in bps, times in the unit their
key names.

The shortest and the longest term, and the shortest last stretch in which nothing is sold, are
not the plan's: whoever deploys sets them, and the pool holds its plan and every extension to
them. Left alone they are the product's, 180 days, 730 days and 14 days. --min-term-days,
--max-term-days and --notice-days make them shorter for a pool whose whole term has to be
watched in an afternoon; a run with any of them says so in its first lines and in its record.

Signs with the key named by --signer, `multi-operator` unless told otherwise: a wallet of its own,
and not the one that runs the shared pool people can see, which big blocks would slow to a
transaction a minute. The pool's owner is --owner, in checksummed form, or the signer; it can
never be changed, and it is the one address that takes money out. The owner puts capital in afterwards, by sending USDC to the
pool's address on HyperCore; this script moves no USDC.

Six contracts go through big blocks: the MultiPool alone is close to six million gas, twice what
a small block holds. The switch is a HyperCore action of the signer's, turned off again whatever
happens. Writes deployments/testnet-<label>.json after every transaction, status field included,
the way ops/deploy_testnet.py does.
