# Design: what the creator of a pool sets

**Status: a design. Only the exam's rows are built ([PAPER-EXAM.md](PAPER-EXAM.md)); the pool
that takes the others is not written yet, and nothing here is deployed.** The pools on the
testnet are the ones in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [SHARED-POOL.md](SHARED-POOL.md), with their
terms fixed the way those documents say.

The idea is one rule for every choice below: the platform does not pick the terms of a pool. The
address that creates the pool sets them once, at creation, they are public before anyone
deposits or buys, and they do not change afterwards. A different set of terms is a different
pool.

A default is what the creation form starts with. The contracts take every value explicitly.
Where the column says "none", there is no value we would put there for the creator: it has to
be chosen, and the demo's value, that of the three-seat pool on the testnet, is given only as an
example of one.

## The pool

| Setting | Type | Bounds | Default | Built |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Investors | one, or several | — | none; it is the first thing the creator chooses | no |
| Sizes on sale | list of amounts | at least one; each above 0 | 5, 10 and 25 for every 100 of the pool | no |
| Share of the pool in work | bps | above 0, at most 10 000 | 8 000: at most 80% in work, the rest stays as a buffer | no |
| Term | time | 6 to 24 months | none within the bounds | no |
| Notice before the term ends | time | fixed | 14 days | no |
| Extending the term | by the creator, before it ends | — | not extended: at the end every position is closed, profit is shared and the pool stops | no |

A seat is taken from the moment an exam on it is bought, and what can still be sold is whatever
fits under the share in work. With a pool of 100 and two seats of 25 sold, 30 are left: six
seats of 5, three of 10 or one of 25.

When the creator extends, they choose what stays. A pool that started with 100 and holds 115 at
the end of its term can be extended on 100 with the 15 withdrawn. In a pool of several
investors the creator extends and each investor decides whether to stay or take their part;
this last rule is the one most likely to change before it is built.

## The exam

Sold for a price, traded on no one's money, judged by the contract.

| Setting | Type | Bounds | Default | Built |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Price | USDC | above 0 | none | no |
| Steps and their targets | list of bps | 1 to 4 steps, each 1 to 10 000 | one step of 1 000 (10%) | yes |
| Drawdown | bps | 1 to 9 999 | none (the demo: 600) | yes |
| Daily loss | bps | 1 to 9 999 | none (the demo: 300) | yes |
| Leverage | times 100 | 100 and up | none (the demo: 500) | yes |
| Assets | list | 1 to 16 from the platform's list | none (the demo: SOL, BTC, ETH) | yes |
| Time for a step | seconds | any; 0 is no deadline | none (the demo: 7 days) | yes |
| Trading days a step needs | count | 0, or what fits the step | 0 | yes |
| Cost of a fill | bps | 0 to 1 000 | none | yes |
| Blocks before a fill, and its window | blocks | 1 to 600 each | none | yes |

## The funded account

Opened by the trader after a pass, on the pool's money, the same size as the exam.

| Setting | Type | Bounds | Default | Built |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Size | — | the exam's size | the exam's size | no |
| Target | bps | 1 to 10 000 | 1 000 (10%) | no |
| Drawdown, daily loss, leverage, assets | as for the exam | as for the exam | none (the demo used the exam's) | no |
| Trader's share of the profit | bps | 0 to 10 000 | none (the demo: 8 000) | no |
| After the target | account closes, account stays, or the trader stops it themselves | — | none | no |

## Against what prop firms offer

Compared with the public rule pages of nine prop firms, five traditional and four trading
crypto, read on 13 October 2026. They are not named: their pages change, and this is a list of
settings, not a statement about any firm.

**Covered by the exam contract.**

- An exam on a simulated balance.
- One step or two (10%, or 8% then 5%, or 10% then 5%); up to four.
- Every step starting on the starting balance, with the exam's profit not carried over.
- A static drawdown from the starting balance, and a daily loss limit.
- A time limit, or none.
- A minimum of trading days in a step.
- A target that counts only with every position closed.
- A pass declared by rule, at once, with no review by the firm.
- A breach that is final.

**Covered by the pool's settings above, not built yet.**

- A menu of sizes, each with its price.
- A funded account of the exam's size.
- The trader's share of the profit.
- A funded account with a target or without one, and what happens at the target.

**Not covered: no setting for it.**

- A trailing drawdown, by the balance at the end of the day or by the highest equity.
- A daily limit that pauses the account for the day and does not end it.
- Profitable days as a condition, as opposed to days traded.
- A consistency rule: the best day no more than a share of the whole profit.
- Expiry after a time without a trade.
- No positions overnight or over the weekend.
- The exam's price returned with the first payout.
- A retry or a reset at a discount, or a limited number of them.
- Payout cycles with different shares, a smallest payout, a cap on payouts.
- Growth of the account: a larger one after a number of months, payouts or targets.
- A monthly price, and a fee to activate the funded account.
- A cap on what one trader may hold across accounts.
- A check of the trader's identity before the funded account. This one is left out on purpose:
  nothing here is decided by us.

One difference is not a setting. At seven of the nine, the funded account is described as
simulated as well, and the firm pays the payouts. Here the funded account is the pool's own
capital on a real exchange account, and the trader's share is a share of what it actually made.
