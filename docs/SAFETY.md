# Safety: what the code holds, and what it does not

Testnet only: the USDC and HYPE here are Hyperliquid testnet tokens, and no external audit of this code has
been completed. This page lists the limits that the contracts, the gateway and Hyperliquid put on each party,
and the gaps between them. Each statement of what the code, the chain or Hyperliquid does points to the
line, the address or the page that makes it true (the table at the end, by its number); what is absent --
a timelock, an audit, a bounty -- has no line to point to, and is said plainly. Nothing here promises
that capital is kept, that it earns anything, or that anyone can leave at once. The lines cited are main's,
the contracts of v3.0.1, which no deployment runs yet; section 3 says which code each deployment runs, and
gives a pool owner's powers in each.

## 1. Enforced controls

- **The trading key cannot send an account's money elsewhere.** A challenge account, and a pool in its
  funded stage, trades through an agent key the account approves on Hyperliquid (S1). Hyperliquid lets an
  agent move money only inside the account itself: an agent-signed transfer must name the account as its
  destination (S2). That is Hyperliquid's permission model, not a check in these contracts. The key can
  still trade the money away, including against a counterparty it chooses.
- **The trader never holds that key.** In this demo the gateway holds the agent keys and signs with them
  (S3). The trader's wallet signs requests to the gateway.
- **Capital stays on the pool's account.** A sale moves only the challenge's capital to the challenge's
  new account on HyperCore (S4); the funded capital stays on the pool's own account. The price is paid
  into the pool contract, and the platform's fee to its recipient, in the same transaction (S5). The
  price comes back to the buyer only if the challenge never starts (S6).
- **A stop and a take go on the book before an opening order.** Before the gateway submits an order that
  may open or grow a position, it places a market stop and a take on Hyperliquid as one `positionTpsl`
  group (S7, S8). If they cannot be placed, the order is not sent.
- **The rules are on chain and do not change.** Daily loss, drawdown, leverage and the list of markets
  are written when a pool is created and copied into each challenge it sells (S9); nothing writes them
  afterwards (S10). Whether an account breaks a rule is read on chain (S11). A stop (`breach`) is
  refused unless a rule is broken (S12); it cuts the account's key (S13) and records the reason in the
  `Stopped` event (S14). The stops so far are on the site's "What happened on chain" page (S15).
- **The shared pool's seats are fixed.** Once the operator seals the book of seats, no seat can be added
  (S16). The pool the site takes deposits into is sealed (S17).
- **The platform's starting shares in the shared pool never leave it** (S18).
- **A pool's owner takes capital out only while no trader holds it.** `withdrawOnCore` works only while
  the pool is idle (S19).

## 2. Trading and exits

- **No rule holds through a price gap.** The rules are checked against the account's equity. A price that
  jumps past the stop triggers it as a market order, which fills beyond the line and only within 10% of the
  trigger, where the order's own price is set (S66): a gap wider than that can leave the position partly or
  wholly open. What a challenge can lose is bounded by its account's capital, the only money the account holds
  (S4), not by its rule. A funded stage trades the funded capital on the pool's own account.
- **Hyperliquid's liquidation and auto-deleveraging apply to every account**, whatever a pool's rules
  say (S20, S21).
- **There are windows.** The gateway's sweep, which puts back a missing stop and moves the lines, comes to
  every account each 30 seconds (S22), and each 15 seconds to an account where a position can stand without a
  stop: an order resting that may open, a position with no stop, positions or stops that changed since the
  last pass, an action just sent (S65). Each wait starts when the sweep before it has finished. A stop refused
  at every pass for 30 seconds in a row, by Hyperliquid or by the signer, is followed by a close at the market
  (S23); an answer not known to be a refusal starts the count again (S67). The close is a reduce-only order
  priced 10% through the mark that fills what it can at once and cancels the rest (S68): it too can be
  refused, or fill only in part. The keeper checks the rules every 30 seconds, plus however long a pass takes
  (S24). Between those, only what already stands on the book acts: the stop, and the take.
- **A halted market is not recognised.** A builder-deployed market (HIP-3) halted by its deployer takes
  every order off, the stop included. The gateway has no notion of a halt: its sweep sees a position
  without a stop and tries to place one at every pass (S25).
- **Leaving the shared pool takes time.** A withdrawal can be asked for from 10 minutes after the holder's
  latest deposit (S26, S27) and cannot be taken back. It is paid at a settlement point, which anyone may run
  once nothing is in motion (S28): in full if the pool's free money covers every request, otherwise the same
  fraction of each (S69), and nothing if it has none (S70). What is not paid stays in the queue, so a
  withdrawal may take several settlement points. Capital in a running challenge or funded stage stays there
  until it ends: only an idle seat's capital can be brought back (S29). The queue holds at most 16 holders: a
  request from a 17th holder is refused, while a holder already in it may ask for more (S30).

## 3. Operator powers

None of the powers below waits for a delay or a vote: there is no timelock anywhere. Two of them are keys
we hold, the key registry's operator and the gateway's host: whoever has either can trade accounts that are not
theirs.

- **The factory's operator**, the deploy key on demo2 (S31, S32), can list or delist markets for new
  pools, while pools already created keep theirs (S33); change the challenge fee and its recipient for
  later purchases, with no cap (S34); set a builder and the most it may charge, which accounts approve
  when they start (S35), and there is none on demo2 (S36); and hand the role to any address in one call
  (S37), an open finding (S38).
- **The key registry's operator** publishes the agent keys (S40), and each new challenge and funded stage
  is given the next free one (S84). On demo2, on the first deployment and on the v3 deployment the operator
  is the deploy key, the key that deployed them (S39, S85, S86): one hot key, not a multisig. Whoever holds
  it decides which agent addresses the next accounts get. With addresses of their own published, they could
  trade every account opened after that, within its rules, as the gateway's host can (below). The operator
  cannot change the key of an account that has one. A published key cannot be withdrawn, by the operator or
  anyone: only the account it is given to retires it (S87), and a key that gains a HyperCore account of its
  own is skipped, and anyone may clear it (S88). Each key published, each key given and each handover of the
  role is an event on chain (S89, S90, S91). The role moves in two steps, the new operator accepting (S41).
  The owner's decision: before mainnet the operator becomes a cold key or a multisig; keeping it in the
  signer's enclave is being considered. On testnet today it is neither.
- **A pool's owner**, in every version, withdraws the pool's capital while it is idle (S19) and the
  challenge prices it has earned at any time (S42); the owner, or the funded trader, can end a funded stage
  without a breach (S43); and the owner cannot change the pool's rules or terms (S10). That is all a pool's
  owner can do on demo2, the site's live deployment, whose contracts are the ones before v3, built from the
  commit its record names (S73); the seats of its shared pools are clones of the same code (S74). In v3 --
  the v3 deployment, demo3, built from commit 23772e2d and tagged `v3-freeze-23772e2d` (S75), and main --
  the owner also can, each only while the pool is idle: send its spot to any address, not only to itself
  (S76); and choose its traders itself, for good, after which the pool sells no challenge (S77, S78). Only an
  owner the factory knows as a MultiPool, a contract, can then fund a trader of its choosing on the pool's
  capital (S79), and that trader can end the stage only if the owner allowed it (S80). In v3 a funded stage's
  agent key is approved for 179 days (S81) and, in its last 14 days (S82), anyone may renew it with a fresh
  key (S83).
- **The shared pool's operator and platform** (S44) started the pool, added its seats and sealed it;
  after the seal it can add nothing (S16). It holds the starting shares, which never leave (S18). This
  pool takes no fee on profit (S45).
- **Whoever holds the gateway's host** holds the agent keys of the accounts it serves, and can sign
  anything Hyperliquid lets an agent sign for them (S3) until the account is stopped. The rules still
  apply after the fact through `breach`.
- **The keepers** hold wallets for gas only. Every call they make is open to anyone (S46, S47).
- **What none of us can do:** send a challenge account's money anywhere but to its trader's share and
  back to its pool (S48, S49); change the rules of an account that is running (S10); or upgrade a pool or
  a challenge, each a minimal clone of a fixed implementation with no upgrade path (S50, S51).

## 4. Closing

- **A challenge** ends by `breach` when a rule is broken, by anyone (S12); by `expire` after its
  deadline, by anyone (S52); by `forfeit`, its trader alone (S53); or by `graduate`, by anyone, once the
  target is met with nothing open and no rule broken, in time (S54). If its capital never arrived or its
  key was spoiled, `abort` refunds the price; the platform's fee stays paid (S6).
- **Then `settle`**, open to anyone, closes what is open. A trader who passed is paid their share of the
  profit (S48); everything else goes back to the pool (S49). A loss is the pool's.
- **A funded stage** opens after a pass, with the key reserved at the sale. If it has not opened within 7
  days, anyone may release the pool (S55), but only when no key is to be had: the reserved key already has an
  account on HyperCore, so it cannot be used (S71), and the key registry counts no free key (S72). While a key
  is to be had, the pool waits for `openFundedStage`, which anyone may call. It ends by `breach`, by the owner
  or the funded trader (S43), or, on a shared-pool seat, once its published term has run, by anyone (S56).
  `settleFunded` then closes the positions. The funded trader is paid a share of the profit only if the stage
  ended without a breach (S57); the capital stays in the pool, which goes back to idle (S58).
- **A pool** has no closing call of its own: its owner withdraws its spot while it is idle (S19). While a
  challenge runs, the pool's capital waits for it to end, up to its deadline.

## 5. Availability and recovery

- **If the host stops,** the stops and takes already on Hyperliquid stay where they are. Nothing moves
  them or places new ones, and no keeper calls `breach`, until it is back. Those calls are open to
  anyone in the meantime (S46, S47).
- **The host reads Hyperliquid on one budget per IP,** 1,200 of weight a minute (S59). Past it, reads are
  refused, and an order that needs one is refused before anything is sent.
- **Money sent straight to a contract.** USDC sent to a pool's address on HyperEVM stays there as a token
  balance: on testnet the bridge credited nothing to a contract bridging to itself (S60), and the owner
  can withdraw only the challenge prices the pool earned (S42). USDC sent to a challenge account on
  HyperCore counts as equity, and can even reach the target without trading (S61).
- **Monitoring can miss things.** Nothing here guarantees that a problem is noticed, or noticed in time.

## 6. Audits and reports

- An internal audit went through these contracts between 25 and 28 September 2026. Each finding and the
  test that pins it is in `docs/AUDIT-FINDINGS.md` (S62). Three are open: a pass can be bought by
  depositing, by design (S61); a pool whose order cap sits under Hyperliquid's minimum (S63); and the
  factory's one-step operator handover (S38).
- No external audit, and no third-party scan, of this code has been published.
- The shared pool contracts are testnet code, outside the reviewed core (S64).
- To report a problem, open an issue in this repository. There is no bug bounty.
