# Trading pools on Hyperliquid, with keys the trader never holds

Working title. Built for the Colosseum Crypto World's Fair, Hyperliquid track. Testnet only:
HyperEVM testnet (chain 998) and mock USDC.

An investor opens a pool. The pool is a contract with its own HyperCore account, and it
holds the capital and the rules: daily loss, drawdown, leverage, and which perps the account
may trade. A trader, a person or an AI agent, pays for a challenge and gets an account of its
own with a slice of that capital. The trader signs orders with their wallet and never holds
the key that signs for Hyperliquid. In this demo those keys are testnet keys held by our pool
gateway, which checks the platform's caps before it signs.

When a rule is broken, anyone can call `breach()`. The contract swaps the account's agent key
for an address nobody controls, cancels the open orders the caller lists and closes the
positions. If the trader reaches the target in time, with no rule broken and no position left
open, `graduate()` moves them on to the pool's own capital under a new key. Anyone may call
that one too.

Usenami Signer, our enclave signing service, is older than this event and takes no part in
this demo. [CONTINUITY.md](CONTINUITY.md) separates what existed before 14 September from what was
built in the window. [AI-USE.md](AI-USE.md) describes how we used AI tools.

## Where it runs

Testnet only, chain 998. The live deployment is the second one, `deployments/testnet-demo2.json`:
the gateway and the keepers have served it since 1 October 2026, and it is where pools are opened
and challenges are bought and traded. The numbers below come from that record and from its own
`block`.

| | |
|---|---|
| app | <https://pools.usenami.io> |
| gateway | <https://pools-api.usenami.io> (`/v1/health` answers without a wallet) |
| `PoolFactory` | `0x5CbCAF8829eD955c4a8aDA2B28Bf75f8ba867222` |
| `KeyRegistry` | `0x53AF27F65Dd7473c890f633aC0025b261307779e` |
| deployed at block | 65736733; 36 agent keys published, 24 on 1 October and 12 on 4 October |

The first deployment, `deployments/testnet-demo.json`, is an archive: factory
`0xf2707FCf99eD546BBA4612783761e7906FA1958e`, key registry
`0x6b256B983b849934e0AA500cF2e3Ca176B0d35BA`, deployed at block 65021402 with 16 agent keys in its
record. Its accounts still answer and the app still reads them; the app sells nothing there and
the gateway signs for none of its accounts.

What has actually happened on both sets of contracts, and how to rebuild the list from the
registry rather than believe it: [docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md).

## How an order travels

1. The trader's wallet signs the order's own fields with EIP-712: account, perp, side, price,
   size, reduce-only, time in force, nonce and expiry. The wallet shows those fields, not a
   hash.
2. The pool gateway reads the chain. The account has to come from our factory and be in a
   trading state, its agent key has to be bound to this trader in `KeyRegistry`, and the perp
   has to be on the account's list. The gateway also refuses an expired request and a nonce it
   has already seen.
3. The gateway checks the order against the platform's caps (a list of perps, a size cap for
   each, 400 USDC per order) and signs the Hyperliquid action with the account's key, which it
   holds. An order over a cap is refused before anything is signed.
4. The gateway checks that the signature recovers to the account's key.
5. If the order may open or grow a position, the gateway first puts a stop and a take for the
   whole position on Hyperliquid itself: the stop where equity would reach the daily-loss or
   drawdown line, the take at the target. The order is not sent if they can't be placed, and the
   trader may move them nearer but cancel neither. Then it submits the order to the Hyperliquid
   testnet.

The caps don't know the account's equity, so they can't enforce rules that depend on it. The
stop on the exchange holds the daily-loss and drawdown lines without waiting for anyone, though
a fast market can fill it past them. The contracts enforce daily loss, drawdown and leverage
after the fact, reading HyperCore through its read precompiles, and anyone may trigger the stop.
**Leverage has no layer before that one on the host today**: the deployed gateway does not
check it and the exchange stop is not on its line. The gateway in this repository refuses, before
signing, an order after which the account could break it; that holds on the host once it is
deployed and `scripts/verify-gateway-deploy.sh` prints PASS. Rule by rule: [docs/GATEWAY.md](docs/GATEWAY.md), "The rules, layer by layer".

More detail: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the contracts and
[docs/GATEWAY.md](docs/GATEWAY.md) for the gateway. What the demo has already done on chain,
and how to rebuild the list from the registry rather than believe it:
[docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md).

## Checking it yourself

[docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md) lists what the contracts have actually recorded so far —
every stop, with the rule it names and the key it cut — and says plainly which parts were staged.

Every account in the app has a page that shows the evidence and says where each piece comes
from:

- the account's agent key and its state in `KeyRegistry`, read from the chain;
- the account's fills on Hyperliquid, set against the pool's rules;
- who holds the keys: in this demo, our gateway. Nothing on the page can prove that, and the
  page says so.

Where the checks stop, and what we don't claim:

- The page checks trades. A signature that never reached the exchange can't be seen from
  outside, so we don't say the gateway has never signed an order against the rules.
- The gateway checks the trader's signature, and we run the gateway, so the operator could,
  technically, submit an order that fits the rules without the trader asking for it.
- In this demo the gateway holds the agent keys. Whoever controls its host can trade those
  accounts, within the caps or not, until someone stops them.
- After a stop, the gateway could still sign for the old key. Hyperliquid refuses the order,
  because that key is no longer the account's agent.
- The investor's limits aren't checked before signing. The gateway applies one platform
  policy, and each pool's rules live in its contract, which enforces them after the fact by
  stopping the account.

## Tested by TestSprite

Live URL: <https://pools.usenami.io> (Hyperliquid testnet, chain 998, mock USDC).

A small [TestSprite](https://www.testsprite.com) suite runs against the live site, not against
the code in a pull request: the site is served from one deployment, with no preview per PR.
Every test only reads pages. None connects a wallet, submits the new-pool form, buys a seat,
trades or signs anything.

What the suite covers (8 tests, all passing on 16 October 2026):

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| Accept demo gate and load pools home | the "testnet demo" notice can be accepted and the pools list opens |
| Open Terms page | the Terms link in the footer opens `#/terms` |
| Open Economics page from header navigation | the Economics link opens `#/economics` |
| Use the economics calculator | the calculator on `#/economics` responds to its inputs |
| Load the evidence page from header navigation | the "On chain" link opens `#/evidence` |
| Open a pool verification page | the "Check it yourself" page opens for a known account |
| Open a non-existent route | an unknown address shows "Not found" |
| Verify header navigation remains available after entry | the header links stay in place after the demo notice |

Tests that read the chain go through the public testnet node, which limits requests per
address, so the suite is run only when needed.

## Running it

You need Foundry 1.7.1, Python 3.12 or newer (we use 3.14) with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Node 20 or newer.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <this repository>
forge build && forge test
uv venv spike/.venv --python 3.14
uv pip install --python spike/.venv/bin/python -r spike/requirements.txt -r agents/requirements.txt
spike/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s gateway/tests -t .
spike/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s agents/tests -t .
spike/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s ops/tests -t .
node --test app/tests/*.test.mjs

# the gates, each with a self-test that makes it fail on purpose
bash scripts/scrub-check.sh && bash scripts/test-scrub-check.sh
bash scripts/identity-check.sh && bash scripts/test-identity-check.sh
spike/.venv/bin/python scripts/abi-check.py && bash scripts/test-abi-check.sh
spike/.venv/bin/python scripts/mutations.py --check && bash scripts/test-mutations-check.sh
```

That is every test in the repository: 126 for the contracts, 65 for the gateway, 52 for the
agents, 100 for ops, 107 for the app. The five suites themselves run in about six seconds on a
laptop; what takes time is once-only — `forge build` and the two installs. The gates and their
self-tests add under a minute.

The mutation stand is the slow one and is worth its own run:

```bash
spike/.venv/bin/python scripts/mutations.py --check   # instant: every mutation still matches its anchor exactly once
spike/.venv/bin/python scripts/mutations.py           # the real thing: breaks one guarantee at a time
```

Measured from a fresh clone of this commit on a laptop: **417 mutations in about fifteen
minutes**, every one of them caught by a test. `--check` takes a twentieth of a second and only
asks whether each mutation still matches its anchor — run it after touching any guarded line, and
the full stand before a release.

🔴 **The full run rewrites the working tree** — it applies each mutation to the file on disk,
runs the suite, and puts it back. Nothing else may run in that checkout while it does, including
the gates above: a self-test that reads a half-mutated source reports a defect that is not there.
Use a second checkout if you want to work while it runs.

Everything below touches the testnet. The scripts refuse any RPC whose chain id isn't 998.
Wallet keys are read from outside the repository: `COLOSSEUM_KEY_DIR` holds one `<name>.key`
(mode 600) and one `<name>.addr` per wallet. The public testnet RPC rate-limits after a
handful of calls; `COLOSSEUM_RPC_URL` (scripts, keeper, agents) and `GATEWAY_RPC_URL` (gateway)
point them at another one.

```bash
# the demo's agent keys: owner-only files in a new directory, and their addresses
spike/.venv/bin/python ops/make_demo_keys.py --out <new directory outside the repo> --count 20

# deploy the contracts and publish those addresses; writes deployments/testnet-<label>.json
spike/.venv/bin/python ops/deploy_testnet.py --label rehearsal --keys-file <that directory>/addresses.txt

# the app: copy the factory, registry and first block from that record into app/config.js,
# and point its gateway at http://127.0.0.1:8787 for a gateway on this machine
python3 -m http.server 8790 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory app

# the gateway, signing with those keys and checking the caps first
GATEWAY_FACTORY=0x... GATEWAY_REGISTRY=0x... \
GATEWAY_SIGNER=demo GATEWAY_KEYS_DIR=<that directory> \
GATEWAY_ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8790 \
spike/.venv/bin/python -m gateway.server

# the keeper: list what is due, then send it
spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.keeper --deployment rehearsal --once --dry-run
spike/.venv/bin/python -m ops.keeper --deployment rehearsal --once

# a scripted trade through the gateway, signed by the trader's wallet
spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.bot rest --deployment rehearsal --account 0x...

# the command line the AI trader uses; --dry-run sends nothing and needs no key
spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment rehearsal pools
spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment rehearsal account 0x...
spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment rehearsal --dry-run order 0x... BTC buy 0.0005 76000
```

On the second deployment the trader is a separate AI agent of the team, holding its own wallet and
trading through the same gateway; [docs/EVIDENCE.md](docs/EVIDENCE.md) says what it did.
[agents/WINDOW-TRADER.md](agents/WINDOW-TRADER.md) holds the prompt written for a trading window
that works only through that command line. The limits are in the client (orders per day and their
size, counted in `agents/state/`), the gateway and the contracts, not in the prompt. `agents/ai_trader.py` gives the same desk to Claude over
the API (`--dry-run` prints the request and calls nothing). The video doesn't use it, and as of
17 September no session has run it against the API.

## Status and limits

The demo is deployed, on testnet: the contracts in the table at the top, the pool gateway and
the keeper on our pools host ([docs/HOSTING.md](docs/HOSTING.md)), and the app at
<https://pools.usenami.io>. On 25 September the site serves the `app/` folder of commit
`589157c7`, checked against it file by file. The shared pool's three test pools are listed in
[docs/EVIDENCE-SHARED-POOL.md](docs/EVIDENCE-SHARED-POOL.md). [CONTINUITY.md](CONTINUITY.md)
tracks each piece by date.

The code is unaudited. We reviewed the contracts internally and fixed what we found; the
limits that remain are listed in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md#what-the-design-does-not-do).
The hackathon version leaves out several traders per pool, a leaderboard, collusion detection,
a token and mainnet. Pool shares exist only in the shared pool, a layer over these pools with
one trader per seat ([docs/SHARED-POOL.md](docs/SHARED-POOL.md)); it runs on testnet and is not
part of the reviewed core.

The app asks each visitor once to confirm they understand it is a testnet demo with mock funds.
