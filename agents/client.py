"""A trader's client for the pool gateway: signs one order, one cancel, or a move of the
account's stop or take with the trader's wallet and posts it. Used by the demo bot, by `agents.ai_trader`, and from the command line by
the Claude Code window that trades the demo:

    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo pools
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo buy 0xPOOL 25
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo account 0xACCOUNT
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo market 0xACCOUNT BTC
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo order 0xACCOUNT BTC buy 0.0005 76000 --type limit
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo cancel 0xACCOUNT BTC 123456
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo close 0xACCOUNT BTC
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo graduate 0xACCOUNT
    spike/.venv/bin/python -m agents.client --deployment demo2 forfeit 0xCHALLENGE

Every command prints one JSON object. The limits are those of `agents.desk`, counted per
wallet, per account and per UTC day in agents/state/, and set in this file: no option raises
them. The wallet's key is read from COLOSSEUM_KEY_DIR and never printed. --dry-run sends
nothing and needs no key. Testnet only.
