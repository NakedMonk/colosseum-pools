    A flat 100 USDC was sized for a 70-USDC challenge. On a funded stage of 700 the same number
    left the agent at 0.57x of a 5x rule -- ten times tamer than the audition it had just passed,
    which is not a cap on recklessness but a cap on the product.

    The share is 0.4 against a headroom of 0.8, so two orders reach the whole exposure the headroom
    allows and two of the four daily orders are left for a correction. 0.5 would also take two, but
    it lets a single order commit 62% of the headroom where 0.4 commits exactly half: same order
    budget, smaller mistake.

    `gateway_max_notional` is what the gateway said it would take, from `/v1/health`. The share can
    exceed it on large capital -- 0.4 of 3500 is 1400 against the demo signer's 400 -- and an order
    the signer rejects costs the agent one of its few daily orders, because that refusal is not
