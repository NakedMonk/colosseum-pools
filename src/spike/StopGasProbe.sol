///           (position and mark), the extra assets' positions;
///         - the cut: a keyless address (HyperCore asked whether it exists) and its approval;

///           mark, size decimals again, the order);
///         - the equity the Stopped event says (the two margins again).
///         The account's own storage, events and the registry's retire are not here; test/spike's
