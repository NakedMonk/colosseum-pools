/// @title PoolShares
/// @notice Many investors' money in one pool of many traders. This contract is the `MultiPool`'s
///         owner, and a share is a claim on a part of the pool's value. The money is USDC and nothing
///         else, and it is locked for the pool's term the way a token lock holds tokens.
///
///         A deposit arrives on HyperCore at an address made for it (`ShareTicket`, like the tickets
///         of `SharedPool`) and becomes shares at the next settlement point, priced at the value
///         without it; from the ticket the money goes straight into the pool. An investor who wants
///         out says so with
///         `requestExit` no later than `notice` before the end of the term, fourteen days in the
///         product, and may take it back until then. From there on what was said holds. In those last
///         days the creator may extend the pool: the extension takes out of the pool exactly what the
///         leaving shares are worth at that moment, or it does not happen. Whoever said nothing stays
///         for the new term. A pool that is not extended stops, and then everyone may leave.
/// @dev Value and shares are in HyperCore spot units, 1e8 = 1 USDC; the first shares are one per unit.
///      The share accounting, the tickets and the way a payment is split and recorded are
///      `SharedPool`'s; what is new is that leaving goes by the term and not by a queue. This
///      contract's own HyperCore balance holds what it owes and little else, and nothing leaves it
///      but payments to holders.
