// Chain reads that go easy on a public node.
//
// Every read of the app goes to one public HyperEVM RPC, from the visitor's own address. Measured on 12 Oct 2026:
// the home page asked it 158 calls in 41 HTTP requests, 50 of them the same call asked twice, and a visitor with
// two tabs and a wallet open got "Could not load this page" on it. The node does not answer 429. It answers
// HTTP 200 with one object for the whole batch, `{"id":null,"error":{"code":-32005,"message":"rate limited"}}`,
// with no Retry-After, and after a burst it kept refusing a single call for about 45 seconds.
//
// So the reads are made gentle in one place, under the provider, where every page's reads pass:
//   - the same call asked twice is asked once: while it is in flight, and for a short time after;
//   - what a contract never changes (its rules, its terms, its owner) is kept for the session;
//   - calls are gathered into batches of at most twenty, and at most two batches are out at a time;
//   - a refusal for the rate is not an error yet: the batch waits and asks again, longer each time, and every
//     other batch waits with it. Only when the last wait is spent do the calls fail, with the node's own refusal.
//
// 13 Oct 2026, measured again: 91 calls in 12 requests one after another, 6.3 seconds for the home page, and a home
// page the visitor had already left went on asking for its 44. So two things more:
//   - reads of the latest state ride together in one call of Multicall3 (app/lib/multicall.js), once the code at
//     its address has been checked. The node counts that call as one. A read that fails inside a pack, and every
//     read of a pack the node would not take, is asked again the plain way, and after such a pack no more are made;
//   - what a page still has waiting when the visitor leaves it is not sent, and an answer that comes back for it
//     is kept but not handed to it, so a view that reads in steps stops there.
// No browser globals here, so node's test runner loads it (app/tests/gentle.test.mjs).
