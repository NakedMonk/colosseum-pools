// profit it was deployed with (0 for the current one, 10% for the earlier ones). The yearly figures are the model's,
// at the base scenario, run on 2 Nov 2026 with the seats at 80% of the pool. Two of the three parts follow from the calculator on the Economics page
// -- the share of the challenge price and the charge on a withdrawal -- and app/tests/platformfees.test.mjs
// recomputes them. The third, the builder fee, rests on a trading volume the calculator's table does not carry and
// nobody has measured, and how it divides between the traders and the pool is not computed.
// No browser globals here, so node's test runner loads it.
