// An indicative percentage for the investor of a pool of many traders: the pool's settings, its amount and its
// term of 6 to 24 months give three numbers, for a bad, a base and a good run of buyers. A model, not a promise.
//
// The arithmetic is our finance model's, carried here line by line from its Python source and held to it by twelve
// cases of inputs and outputs, to the sixth decimal (app/tests/poolquote.test.mjs). The table it reads,
// app/data/pool-quote-units-2026-10-13.json, is a Monte Carlo of how five kinds of trader do in an exam and on a
// funded account: 30 000 paths a cell, seed 20261013.
//
// What the model holds fixed, and so what an estimate exists for: an exam drawdown of 6%, 3% a day, 30 days a step,
// 5x leverage, an exam priced at 1% of the seat, the platform's fees (0.5% of the price, 0.5% of a withdrawal, the
// builder fee of 0.05%), and a seat that is held from the moment its exam is bought. For anything else there is
// no estimate, and quote() says so instead of returning a number.
//
// No browser globals and no library here, so node's test runner loads it.
