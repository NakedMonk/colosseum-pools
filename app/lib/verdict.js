// A stopped account is read twice over: the contract recorded a reason when it stopped it, and
// anyone can also ask the contract what it makes of the account right now. Those two answers
// drift apart the moment the account is settled and its money leaves: an empty account is a
// hundred per cent below where it started, so the live reading says "drawdown" whatever the
// stop was actually for. On 24 Sep 2026 that is what the demo showed a visitor -- "Drawdown" on
// a challenge the contract had stopped for leverage.
//
// So: if a reason was recorded, that is the answer, and the live reading is not shown next to
// it as an equal. The live reading is for accounts that are still trading, where it is the only
// thing that can be asked.

 * stopped trading for good -- a challenge past Active, a pool in Closing; `waiting` says it has not
 * begun -- a challenge that is bought and not started (`notActiveYet`).
 *
 * A challenge that passed is as empty as one that was stopped: it hands its capital back and
 * ends at Settled with no reason recorded, so without `finished` the live reading would call a
 * pass a drawdown. Review caught that before the first graduate could show it to anyone.
