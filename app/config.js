  // holds each one to them, so the site and the host cannot part silently.
  //   factory, registry  the deployment's PoolFactory and KeyRegistry;
  //   deployBlock        its first block: where the check-it-yourself page says its history starts; nothing scans
  //                      back towards it (app/lib/keys.js);
  //   deployer           the deploy key: the pools it owns are our benches, which the list names (app/lib/listing.js);
  //   platformAssets     the perp indices the factory lists. The chain stays the authority -- the new-pool form asks
  //                      isPlatformAsset for each -- this only keeps the form from probing every perp at once.
  //   sharedPool         the shared pool #/shared opens when the link names no address, and the only one the page
  //                      takes a deposit into: the network's first shared entry on the live factory. Its seats are
  //                      made by this deployment's factory.
  //   sharedPoolRecord   the label of that pool's record: the page's test holds the address to it. The archive has
  //                      none: its shared pools open by address and take no deposit.
  //   liveRunPool        a pool the team opened on the deployment after it was deployed, for a live run. The deploy
  //                      key owns it as it owns the benches, and its terms are not a bench's, so the list names it
  //                      apart (app/lib/listing.js). No record carries it; scripts/app_config.py keeps it.
  //   assetLeverage      true for a factory of v3 (its record names a PaperExamImpl), whose Rules carry each asset's
  //                      own leverage cap (assetLeverageX100): createPool then sends five fields
  //                      (app/lib/deployments.js, poolRules) and the pages show those caps. Absent for a factory
  //                      before v3, which takes four.
  // The live one is what the pool gateway and the keepers serve: pools are bought, traded and opened there. An
  // archive one is kept so its records can still be read and checked: it sells nothing.
