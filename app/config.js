  //   deployBlock        its first block: where the check-it-yourself page says its history starts; nothing scans
  //                      back towards it (app/lib/keys.js);
  //   deployer           the deploy key: the pools it owns are our benches, which the list names (app/lib/listing.js);
  //   platformAssets     the perp indices the factory lists. The chain stays the authority -- the new-pool form asks
  //                      isPlatformAsset for each -- this only keeps the form from probing every perp at once.
  //   sharedPool         the shared pool #/shared opens when the link names no address, and the only one the page
  //                      takes a deposit into. Its seats are made by this deployment's factory.
  //   sharedPoolRecord   the label of that pool's record, deployments/testnet-<label>.json: the page's test holds
  //                      the address to it. A deployment may come to hold several shared pools; this names the
  //                      current one. The archive has none: its shared pools open by address and take no deposit.
  //   liveRunPool        the pool the team opened for the live run on 3 Oct 2026 (createPool in block 65902379).
  //                      The deploy key owns it as it owns the benches, and its terms are not a bench's, so the
  //                      list names it apart (app/lib/listing.js). No record in deployments/ carries it: those
  //                      say what was deployed, and this pool was opened on the deployment afterwards.
  // The live one is what the pool gateway and the keepers serve since 1 Oct 2026: pools are bought, traded and opened
  // there. The archive is the first deployment, kept so its records can still be read and checked: it sells nothing.
