// "How the platform earns" on the Economics page (app/lib/platformfees.js, app/views/economics.js): the charges
// planned for mainnet, what the model says they come to, and a calculator that shows the pool before them. The

// and a row "Platform's fee, a year": a tariff that was dropped, shown next to the one that replaced it.
