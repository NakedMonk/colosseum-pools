// The levers an investor sets, on the Economics page: where the stop sits, the leverage, the coins. The figures are the
// cascade package's own lever runs (stress/results/levers-2026-09-29.json, made by stress/make_levers.py), copied into
// the table's block `levers`; the card reads every one of them from there. The stop on the exchange runs on this site
// since 29 Sep 2026, and the card says so; the worst case comes last, and it is named as the case without that stop.
