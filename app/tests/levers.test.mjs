// the table's block `levers`; the card reads every one of them from there. The leverage on the page is the one the
// leverage rule v1.2 allows each coin, and 10x on every seat beside it; 3x, 5x and the list with alts stay in the table.
// The stop on the exchange runs on this site since 29 Sep 2026, and the card says so; the worst case comes last, and it
