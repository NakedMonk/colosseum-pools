// An investor's withdrawal of a pool's capital on HyperCore (app/lib/withdraw.js, app/views/pool.js). The call is
// a HyperEVM transaction that asks HyperCore to move the money, and it succeeds whatever HyperCore then does. On
// 4 Oct 2026 an investor asked for 771.56 against 771.556173: two transactions went through, nothing moved, and
// the page said "Sent" twice. The numbers and the ledger entry below are that day's.
