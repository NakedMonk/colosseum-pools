"""The stop and the take the gateway keeps on Hyperliquid for every position an account may hold.

A pool's rules are enforced by the contracts after the fact: someone sees a broken rule and calls
`breach`, and HyperCore closes the positions a few seconds later. In a fast market that is too
late. So the gateway also leaves the closing to Hyperliquid itself: before it submits an order that
may open or grow a position, it makes sure the account has, for that asset and that direction,

- a STOP at the rule line: the mark price at which the account's equity would reach the nearest
  rule, the static drawdown floor or the day's loss floor, whichever is higher; and
- a TAKE at the target: in a challenge, the mark price at which equity reaches the pass target;
  in a funded stage, which has no target of its own, at most one challenge target (`targetBps`
  of the equity at the moment) away.

Both are Hyperliquid position TP/SL orders: reduce-only, triggered by the mark price, executed as
market orders, and sized 0, which Hyperliquid reads as "the whole position", however large it
grows. Measured on testnet (spike/tpsl_probe.py, 28 Sep 2026): they can be placed before the
position exists and wait for it; several can stand side by side; Hyperliquid removes every one of
them when the position closes; `batchModify` moves one in a single action.

With more than one position the budget (equity minus the floor) is shared in proportion to the
notional of each: every stop sits the same fraction of its mark away, so if all of them are hit
together the account loses exactly the budget. Orders resting on the book that could open or grow
a position count as filled at the mark, which never places a stop looser than the one their fills
would need. The take is split the same way.

The trader may move a stop nearer the mark, never away from it, and may move a take anywhere
between the mark and the target. Cancelling either is refused. A background sweep repeats the
check, so a position that opens later, from an order that rested, gets the same protection.

A challenge's target is an amount, so its take has to keep up with everything the account pays while
the position is open, and funding is paid every hour. The sweep carries a take the GATEWAY placed
out to the line once it stands short of it; a take the TRADER moved stays where the trader put it,
short or not, because taking the profit early is theirs to decide. Only for an account whose
exposure is one position on one asset: with a second asset, or with an order resting that would
grow the position, the line moves with the price. A funded stage's take is placed and then left
where it is. Measured on 3 October 2026: a
take placed at 85378 stood there for six hours while funding took 0.178665 USDC, fired, and left
the account at 70.204304 against a target of 70.28.

    that guards a position is only ever moved nearer the market; one that guards nothing yet
    (the position isn't there) simply follows the line. A take is left where it is while it is
    within the target.

    With `follow_takes` -- a challenge, whose target is an amount and not a distance -- one take is
    held to the line instead: the gateway's own. It is moved to the line when it stands more than
    TAKE_LAG_BPS of the mark away from it, short or beyond, and left alone inside that. Funding
    lowers the equity, which moves the stop's line TOWARDS the market and the take's line AWAY from
    it; "only ever nearer" follows the first and ignores the second, and the take then closes the
    position below the target. `trader_takes` holds the triggers the trader asked for, by asset and
    direction: a take standing exactly on one of them is theirs and is treated as before.

    A funded stage has no target of its own -- its line is one target's worth of the equity it has
    NOW, so it recedes as the position gains -- and a take that followed it would never fire.

    With `hold_takes` -- a funded stage -- a take that stands with its position is not moved at all.
    Its line is worked out from the mark and the equity of the moment, so when the position LOSES
    the line comes after the price, and "a take beyond the line comes in" pulled the take along with
    it, onto the losing side of the entry. Measured on 4 October 2026: a short entered at 84955 with
    its take at 84715, the price went to 85206, and the take stood at 84967. A take is placed one
    target from where the position is opened, and stays there.

    `unvalued` names the assets whose position the account's answer gave no value for. Their lines
    are worked out from two requests, so a take that stands with such a position is not moved
    either: pulled in by what the price did between the requests, it would close the position short
    of its target. The stop is still brought nearer when the line says so. The stop is what holds
    the pool's rule, and a new day's floor or a payment out of the account has to reach it. Over
    time the difference between two requests costs the trader room; a single placement can stand
    that difference too far, until a later sweep.
