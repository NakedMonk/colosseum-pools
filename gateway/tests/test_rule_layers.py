"""Each of a pool's rules against the gateway: what it refuses before it signs, what it leaves to
the stop and the take on the exchange, and what it leaves to the contract and the keeper alone.
docs/GATEWAY.md, "The rules, layer by layer", is the table these tests hold.

Leverage is refused before the signature by this commit's gateway: an order after which the
account could break the pool's leverage rule is not signed (`403 over_leverage`). The pools host
ran release 4900bcb1 when this was written, which does not read the rule; the check holds there
only once a release with it is deployed and scripts/verify-gateway-deploy.sh prints PASS.
