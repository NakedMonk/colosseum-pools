"""The demo's signer: testnet agent keys held by the gateway itself, and the platform's caps
checked in code before anything is signed.

The demo doesn't use Usenami Signer. Its agent keys are ordinary testnet keys made for it
(`ops/make_demo_keys.py`), kept on the gateway host as owner-only files, one `<name>.key`
per key; the address comes from the key, never from a file name. `KeyRegistry` publishes
the addresses as before. A key file can sign anything Hyperliquid lets an agent sign, so
whoever holds the host holds these keys.
