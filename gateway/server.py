"""Pool gateway HTTP server.

    GATEWAY_FACTORY=0x… GATEWAY_REGISTRY=0x… GATEWAY_SIGNER=demo GATEWAY_KEYS_DIR=~/… \\
        spike/.venv/bin/python -m gateway.server

GATEWAY_SIGNER picks who signs. `demo`, what the demo runs: the gateway signs with testnet
keys from GATEWAY_KEYS_DIR and checks the platform's caps before it signs (gateway/demo_signer.py).
`signer`: it asks a Usenami Signer gateway (SIGNER_URL, SIGNER_TOKENS_FILE); the demo doesn't
use this mode.

POST /v1/order   one order, one cancel, or moving the account's stop or take, see docs/GATEWAY.md
POST /v1/faucet  one exam's dUSDC and its gas in HYPE for a tester, where the deployment has a faucet
                 (gateway/faucet.py)
GET  /v1/contacts?pool=0x…  the contacts a pool's owner left for its traders and co-investors, and
POST /v1/contacts           the owner's signed record that replaces them, where the gateway has a
                            directory for them (gateway/contacts.py)
GET  /v1/health  liveness and configuration summary (no secrets)

Before an order that may open or grow a position goes, the gateway puts a stop at the pool's
rule line and a take at the target on Hyperliquid itself (gateway/protect.py), and a sweep every
GATEWAY_PROTECT_EVERY seconds (default 15) keeps them there.

Testnet only: refuses to start unless the RPC reports chain 998, and submits only to
Hyperliquid's testnet API.
