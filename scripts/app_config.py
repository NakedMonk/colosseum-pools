"""Writes the app's settings, app/config.js, for one network: from spike/hlspike/network.py and from that network's
entries in deployments/LIVE.json, with their records.

    python3 scripts/app_config.py [--network testnet|mainnet] [--commit SHA] [--root DIR] [--gateway URL] [--out FILE]

The committed app/config.js is its testnet output, and app/tests/config.test.mjs holds the two equal: change
network.py or LIVE.json, run `python3 scripts/app_config.py --out app/config.js`, and commit both. With --commit it
reads that commit's files instead of this checkout's: scripts/pack-site.sh packs a mainnet site that way, from the
commit it packs. --root reads another directory laid out like this repository (the tests' examples). --gateway
puts another gateway in, for a gateway on this machine (http://127.0.0.1:8787); the test then goes red until the
committed file is written again without it.

The site reads the network's `live` entry, then its `archive` ones, in LIVE.json's order, and opens the first
`shared` entry on the live one's factory. A network with no live entry has nothing for a site to read, and the
script stops rather than write settings for one. It only reads files and needs no key or network.
