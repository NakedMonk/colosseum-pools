"""What is left on the challenge accounts that have settled, read from the chain. It only reads and needs no key.

    spike/.venv/bin/python scripts/settled_accounts.py [--out FILE] [--md FILE] [--red-above USDC]

A settled account can still receive money: a late fill, a send of its own that landed after the settlement, a
donation. `ChallengeAccount.sweep()` sends whatever is there back to the pool, and anyone may call it. This reads
whether there is anything for it to send. With `--red-above USDC` it also exits 2 when a settled account holds that
much or more -- its spot USDC on HyperCore, what its perp accounts would let it withdraw and its USDC on HyperEVM,
together -- which is what the weekly watch (.github/workflows/settled-accounts-watch.yml) goes red on.
It also reads who operates each deployment's key registry, operator() and pendingOperator(), and exits 1 when
either is not what the record says: the deployer and nobody pending, or, after a handover at the deploy
(registry_operator), the deployer and the address given while it is pending, that address once accepted. The
weekly watch goes red on that too; money left behind (2) is said first.

Every account a factory creates, a pool or a challenge, is a clone made with CREATE, so its address follows from the
factory's address and nonce. The accounts are found that way, not from the factory's logs: HyperEVM answers
eth_getLogs over 50 blocks at most and times old ranges out. For each challenge it reads, at one block:
- on HyperEVM: `status()`, `returnAt()`, the HYPE balance and the deployment's USDC balance;
- on HyperCore: the spot USDC balance, the perp account's value and withdrawable amount (the pool's dex too, on a
  builder dex), and every non-funding ledger update with its time.

It reads the network COLOSSEUM_NETWORK names, testnet unless it names mainnet (spike/hlspike/network.py), and the
deployments deployments/LIVE.json lists for that network: the challenges of its live and testers entries, and the
seats of the shared pool the site opens (watched()).
