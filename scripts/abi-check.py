"""The structs the contracts define, against the copies of them the app and the agents carry.

    ./scripts/abi-check.py            # exit 0 clean, 1 a mismatch, 2 the check could not run

`Rules` and `Terms` cross three languages. Solidity defines them; `app/lib/chain.js` repeats them
as an ethers signature; `agents/desk.py` repeats their types for the call encoder. Change the
struct and forget one copy and nothing fails loudly: the app decodes a pool's terms into the wrong
fields, or refuses to decode them at all, and the first place anyone notices is a pool that will
not open. That is a silent failure with a long fuse, and it fires on the day someone is watching.

So: read the compiled ABI, read the two copies, compare. Types always; names too where the copy
carries them, because a swap of two fields of the same width is exactly the mistake that is
invisible otherwise.
