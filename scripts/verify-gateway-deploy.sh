# It asks the gateway's /v1/health for the commit its release names (gateway/server.py, REVISION),
# checks that the commit is on origin/main, checks it out into a directory of its own and runs there the
# tests of the leverage check before the signature: an order over the pool's rule is refused before
# anything is signed, an ordinary order goes, and an order that takes the leverage exactly to the rule
# goes. It changes nothing on the host and nothing in this checkout. The last line says PASS or FAIL.
# A health-url may be file:///… for a saved answer; VERIFY_ANY_COMMIT=1 lets a commit that is not on
# origin/main through, to try this script before its commit is merged.
