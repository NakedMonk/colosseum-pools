# to go red and to name the copy it is unhappy with. Then breaks a copy so it no longer parses,
# and requires exit 2 -- "could not run", never mistaken for "the copies disagree". Then puts the
# tree back and requires green.

# reports success while leaving a source file drifted would be worse than no test.
# A check that cannot go red proves nothing, which is the only reason this file exists.
