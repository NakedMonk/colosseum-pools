#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The site, packed for upload from one commit:
#
#   ./scripts/pack-site.sh [--network testnet|mainnet] <commit> [out-dir]
#
# Copies app/ of that commit file by file from its blobs into out-dir (default
# ~/Downloads/pools-app-<first 8 of the commit>), checks every file against its blob, and writes
# build.json beside index.html: {"commit": "<the full hash>"}. The site shows that commit in its
# footer, so anyone can check the copy they are looking at against the code it came from.
# build.json is the one file that is not in the commit; the last line says it apart from the rest.
#
# Beside out-dir, not in it, goes <out-dir>.sha256: a sha256 for every file of the pack, build.json
# included, as `shasum -a 256 -c` reads it from inside out-dir. scripts/verify-live.py checks the site
# against it once the folder is uploaded. It stays out of the folder because the folder is what is
# uploaded, and build.json is to remain the one file on the site that is not in the commit.
#
# --network mainnet packs the same commit for mainnet. Its config.js is then not the commit's, which is testnet's:
# it is what that commit's scripts/app_config.py writes for mainnet, from the same commit's
# spike/hlspike/network.py and deployments/LIVE.json, and build.json says so: {"commit": "<hash>", "network":
# "mainnet"}. config.js is checked against that output and every other file against its blob, as for testnet. The
# script stops when the commit has no live mainnet deployment, and the packer with it, writing nothing. Testnet, the
# default, packs as it always has: the commit's own config.js and build.json with the commit alone.
