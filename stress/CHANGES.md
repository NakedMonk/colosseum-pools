# Changes

## 25 Sep 2026 — after the bot review of the public package

Six review notes; four touched the tool or the text, one the anchor, one the recipe. Every fix has a
check in `test_pool_stress.py` or `test_anchor.py` and a breakage in `mut_pool_stress.py` that turns
it red again.

1. **Last minute of a day** (`pool_stress.py`, `episode`). When the line was crossed in the last
   minute of a day and `--lag` was 1 or 2, the exit was taken at the *open* of that same minute — a
   price from before the crossing. Now the exit is that minute's close, the last price the keeper
   would see, and the path to liquidation runs through the whole minute. Moves a handful of
   late-day entries by 0.01 pp in the per-coin means and medians (2026-06-05, short side); no
   headline number.
2. **What a liquidated seat keeps** (`episode`). The tool kept the maintenance margin (about 8 % of
   the seat at 5× and 2 %, 11.8 % for a short) while the README said "the seat loses everything".
   Now it is a bracket, like every other figure here: at the lower bound (`--exec open`) the seat
   keeps the margin, at the upper bound (`--exec worst`) it loses everything. Hyperliquid's
   documentation: a liquidation through the book leaves "any remaining collateral" with the trader;
   a backstop liquidation (equity below 2/3 of the maintenance margin) "is not returned to the
   user". This is what moves the upper ends below.
3. **Seats aligned by time** (`seats_report`, new `entry_minutes`). The five seats were entered by
   bar *index*; with a minute missing in one coin that is a different moment per coin. Now the
   entries are the minutes present in every coin, matched by timestamp. The snapshot has no gaps,
   so nothing moved; the tool is now safe for data that has them.
4. **The bracket sentence.** The README claimed every range was `--lag 0` → `--exec worst`; every
   table was in fact `--lag 1 --exec open` → `--lag 1 --exec worst`. The text now says what the
   tables do, and the anchor checks the sentence.
5. **The recipe** ran `test_anchor.py` from `/tmp/fresh`, where it does not exist. Fixed; the anchor
   parses the recipe and fails if the working directory drifts again.
6. **The anchor** compared three sections field by field and skipped the rule block — the published
   `lag1` file lacked the `исполнение` key the tool now writes. The anchor compares every section,
   the field sets included, and the layout file too. `make_results.py` is the one command that
   writes `results/`, so nothing in it is hand-made.

### A defect the review did not name, found while re-running

**Short-side liquidations were never flagged.** The liquidation flag compared the seat's equity to
`mm × leverage × equity_in`, which is the residual of a *long* at its liquidation price; a short's
notional grows with the price, so its residual (11.8 %) sat above that threshold and the flag stayed
off while the loss was already capped at the liquidation price. The published "88.5 %" for "all
five seats on SOL" was that cap: five liquidated shorts with the margin counted as kept. The flag is
now set by the price path, not by a threshold.

### Numbers that moved (open → worst; the open end never moved)

| figure | 20 Sep files | 25 Sep files |
|---|---|---|
| wide list, 10 Oct, worst entry 21:18 | 83.7–87.1 % ($75 299–$78 362) | **83.7–94.1 %** ($75 299–$84 712) |
| wide list, 10 Oct, short side, worst entry 21:21 / 21:22 | 80.0–84.8 %, "0 liquidated" | 80.0–95.7 %, 3–4 liquidated |
| default list, big seats on the calm coins | 23.9–39.3 %, none liquidated | **23.9–40.0 %**, three SOL seats (short, worst price) |
| default list, big seat on SOL | 31.7–63.6 %, none | **31.7–70.0 %**, the SOL seat (short, worst price) |
| default list, all five seats on SOL | 45.2–88.5 %, none | **45.2–100 %**, all five (short, worst price) |
| per coin, 10 Oct, SOL short, worst | 88.46 % | 100.0 % |
| overshoot, maximum | 89 pp | 89 pp at the open, 97 pp at the worst price |
| liquidated share, worst price, per side | long 0.02 %, short 0.00 % | long 0.02 %, short 0.02 % |

Unchanged: every lower bound, every median, both p99 columns, "three of five seats liquidated" on
the long side of the wide list, "seven of eight days over the cap, three over 20 %".

## 26 Sep 2026 — third version, after the bot's review of the second

Three notes on robustness; none touched a published number. `make_results.py` was re-run after the
changes and every file in `results/` came out byte-identical.

1. **Delay and hourly entries by time** (`pool_stress.py`). The keeper's delay was `j + lag` bars and
   the hourly entries were every 60th bar; on data with a missing minute a bar number is no longer a
   minute. The exit is now the first bar at or after `crossing + lag minutes` (`entry_indices` picks the
   entries by timestamp, `entry_minutes` already did so for the seats). On gap-free data this is the
   same bar as before, which is why nothing moved. Checks 20–21a and four breakages.
2. **"Simultaneously"** (`seats_report` docstring). The seats enter the same minute; each crosses its
   line in its own minute. The docstring said "simultaneously"; it now says what the code counts. The
   README never said it. Check 23 and one breakage.
3. **Repeated rows in a fresh run** (`test_anchor.py`). The comparison keyed rows by (day, coin, side)
   and a repeated key collapsed silently. It now compares row counts and distinct keys first; a
   self-test of the comparison (`test_anchor.py --selftest`) runs at the start of every anchor run and
   under the breakage stand, with four breakages of the anchor itself.

Also: the loader refuses a series whose minutes repeat or run out of order, naming the coin and the
minute (check 22, two breakages) — a duplicate bar would otherwise have moved the numbers silently.

## 29 Sep 2026 — the levers: an addition, nothing published moved

`make_levers.py` runs the tool, unchanged, once for each of three choices an investor makes around the
rules: where the stop sits (`--lag 0`, on the exchange at the line; `--lag 1`, a keeper a minute
late, at the open and at the worst price of the window), the leverage (3x, 5x), and the coins (the
wide list; BTC, ETH and SOL with the big seats on the calm coins). Twelve cells, long side, written
to `results/levers-2026-09-29.json`; README.md has the table. `test_anchor.py` runs it again and
compares every cell, and checks the README's table against the file.

Where a cell overlaps a published run it is that run: the keeper at 5x on the wide list is the
headline's 83.7–94.1 %, three of five seats liquidated, and the exchange at 5x on it is the lag 0
file's 3.2 %. The other result files were not re-made and did not change.

`--lag 0` was published "for completeness" and never quoted as a bound. It still is never quoted
as a bound on a keeper; the lever table uses it for what it is, a stop resting on the exchange at
the line, before its fill in a book nobody has measured in a cascade. The sentence in README.md
says so now.

The book's cost on top of the line is in the lever file as well, derived by `make_levers.py` from
`results/hl-book-2026-09-27.json`: the output of `book/analyze_l2.py` over our own l2Book snapshots of
Hyperliquid mainnet, 25–27 Sep 2026, a calm market. Each cell is the worse of the two sides. The
collector, the analyzer and their checks are in `book/`; the raw snapshots are not published.

## 29 Oct 2026 — the levers at the leverage rule v1.2: an addition, nothing published moved

The leverage rule v1.2 of 27 Oct 2026 allows each coin its own leverage, BTC and ETH 10x and SOL 5x.
`pool_stress.py` takes one leverage for each seat (`--seat-lev`), the seats' capital (`--seats-usd`)
and the whole pool (`--pool-usd`, which adds the pool's share to the seats' report, worked out from the
loss before it is rounded to the dollar). Without them it runs as before, and the files it wrote do not
change.

`make_levers.py` writes `results/levers-2026-10-29.json`: the cells at 3x and 5x as before, 10x on every
seat, and the rule's leverage on BTC, ETH and SOL (the rule allows none of the wide list's alts, so that
cell is on the default list alone). The seats hold 80% of a $100k pool, the default share of a pool's
plan (inWorkBps 8000), in the same proportions as before; each cell gives the loss as a share of the
seats' capital and of the pool. A share of the seats' capital does not move with their size: run at 90%
(`--in-work-bps 9000`), the script gives the 29 Sep file's twelve cells field for field. In the 80% file
two medians of the exchange cells read 3.14 and 3.22 against 3.13 and 3.23: those are exactly halfway
between two hundredths, and rounding a float lands either side of it.

`results/levers-2026-09-29.json` stays as it was published. `test_anchor.py` makes both runs and checks
the new file, the twelve old cells at 90%, the rule's three cells and the README's table.

## 29 Oct 2026 — the cascade at the leverage rule v1.2: an addition, nothing published moved

`make_cascade.py` runs the tool on 10 Oct 2025 for the layouts of `make_results.py` on BTC, ETH and SOL, each seat at
the leverage the rule allows its coin, both sides, the keeper a minute late at the open and at the worst price of the
window; and every seat on each coin in turn, since at the rule's leverage the riskiest coin is not known in advance.
It writes `results/cascade-v1.2-2026-10-29.json`, with the cases the Economics page reads: the worse side of the worse
layout as a share of the seats' capital. The big seats on the calm coins take 40.2–67.2 %, the big seat on SOL
42.5–84.4 %, every seat on one coin 68.2 % (ETH at 10x) to 100 % (SOL at 5x).

Run at 5x on every seat with the seats at 90% of the pool, the script gives the six runs of the 25 Sep layout file row
for row; `test_anchor.py` makes both runs. The layout file stays as it was published, and so do the four run files
the overshoot and the wide list are read from, at 5x.
